1) If a new page is the result of an action then the method should return the Page Object of the new page
2) Hermetic Test Pattern - Each test class must be completely independent and self-sufficient.
    The advantages are
        1) Independent start
        2) Stable Independent Test methods
3) Utility methods can be used to get smaller works not related to interaction with webpages. Basically helper functions.
    For Example: sleep method can be created here because the Thread.sleep() requires the callee function to handle exception.
    When we create it in util with try catch block, we can just call the util method to use sleep. The code will look cleaner.
    Other examples like create random string, random number, etc can be a part of util class.
    utility methods are always static so that it can be called without object creation
